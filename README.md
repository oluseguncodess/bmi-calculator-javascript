WHAT THIS PROGRAM DOES! 

The javascript code i've written;
a. Uses functions to generate the bmi of a person through the input of the person's weight and height in the function respectively. 
b. Use if / else statements to create conditional to determine if a person is underweight, has a normal weight or overweight.
